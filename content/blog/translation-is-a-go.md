After a short delay and some additional testing, we're now ready to start accepting user translations to replace our current machine translations! We'll be using Google Sheets to host the .xlsx file that contains all the language strings. We believe it's the easiest and most efficient method available to allow anyone the opportunity to help translate JMM without having to know how to use Visual Studio or edit .resx files.

We've updated the [Translate JMM](https://shokoanine.com) page with new information and the Google Sheets link for those interested in helping translate JMM.
