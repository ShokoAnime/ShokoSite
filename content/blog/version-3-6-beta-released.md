After completing our internal testing, we're pleased to release a public beta for the upcoming version 3.6!

If you take a look at the [changelog](https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog) you'll see that a lot of work has gone into JMM version 3.6 with new features added, various improvements to existing features and functionality and fixing quite a few bugs. I've highlighted the two biggest changes and what the focus of this beta, however there are a lot of great additions with version 3.6 so please check the changelog for the full list.

### Collection Caching

Users will now see and experience a significant speed boost when viewing and maintaining their collection. With the exception of Anime Buddy, every program and plugin has been updated to benefit from the cache addition. These changes will be most noticeable for users with bigger collections as that's where the benefits of a cache really shine, however even users with smaller collections will still benefit from it with the near instant load times.

Please note, collection caching is a new feature and while we've performed exhaustive testing, there are bound to be bugs and issues we never encountered. If you happen to encounter any issues please report them on GitHub so we can investigate.

### Streaming

One of the most requested additions to JMM is finally available! Users will now be able to stream their collection to any JMM supported program or plugin with watched states being updated as normal. Our [streaming documentation](https://shokoanime.com/) is up and should get everyone started, as this is a new feature we'll continue to make updates as needed to make sure we cover all issues that might arise.

Please note, streaming is a new feature and while we've performed exhaustive testing, there are bound to be bugs and issues we never encountered. If you happen to encounter any issues please report them on GitHub so we can investigate.

Make sure to join us on Discord if you need help and post any issues you might encounter on GitHub.

### My Anime 3 Users

Due to the changes in version 3.6, all previously supported skins are no longer supported, **Titan** is the only skin that is currently supported but it too needs some work. If anyone would like to update the previous skins or include support for others skins please contact us on Discord.

### Beta Information And Download

Beta specific information and the download link can be found on our [Beta Page](https://shokoanime.com/), it is imperative that you read everything on that page. Failure to do so could result in the loss of your collection.
