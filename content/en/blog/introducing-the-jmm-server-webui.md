One of the main goals for JMM is to make the programs and plugins as accessible to as many people as possible regardless of operating system. This has been a goal of the project for a very long time but has seen minimal progress, until today as we're pleased to announce that we're now one step closer to making this goal a reality.

We'd like to introduce everyone to out newest project, the JMM Server Web UI which you can see in the screenshot above. The goal of the JMM Server Web UI project is to allow users to access JMM Server regardless of operating system and even device so you always have access to your collection. While the project is still in it's infancy we've already outlined the major updates to come and while we won't be sharing the exact details of our update outline at this time as we don't want to commit to certain features or timetables that could and might change as the project continues to develop. We want and encourage our users to submit feedback and requests so they can help change and shape the Web UI to help us make it a better application.

The Web UI is only made possible thanks to the work being done on adding an API to JMM allowing for potentially unlimited uses that will not only be public but also be coming to JMM in the near future. We'll be sharing our complete plan for the future direction of JMM very soon so keep checking back for more information. However we felt it wouldn't be right to just talk about a Web UI without letting our users give it a try. We've uploaded an early build for use so our users can give it a try! For those of you who decide to try it out please keep in mind that a lot of the features are still being implemented and only the login screen and dashboard work at the moment.

The following download includes a compatible copy of JMM Server which you can use to test out the Web UI. Current versions of JMM Server, both 3.5.0.1 and 3.6 will not work with the Web UI as they do not contain the API needed to run the Web UI. Once JMM Server is running input the following into  your web browser, **127.0.0.1:8111** and on the login screen you'll input the user account used in JMM, **Default** to login.

**DO NOT USE YOUR ACTUAL DATABASE WITH THIS BUILD, IT WILL NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE ACTUAL 3.6 RELEASE IF YOU DO!**

Additional information will be added to the website in the next couple of days but for now you can learn more about the JMM Server Web UI from the GitHub project page.
