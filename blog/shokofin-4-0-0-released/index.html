</span></span></code></pre></div><p>(<em>The dare-devils reading this can replace <code>stable</code> with <code>dev</code> for a higher chance of breakage during updates.</em> üòà)</p><p>The release was delayed <em>a bit</em> to ensure we ironed out any major bugs in the plugin while we waited for Jellyfin to become stable <em>enough</em> for us to proceed. This extra time has allowed us to deliver a more polished stable release experience for all users. üôÇ</p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s start with the positives: we have new major features, bug fixes, Jellyfin 10.9 support, an overhauled settings page, and other smaller changes since the last release. The best part is, we still only require the same ol&rsquo; <strong>Shoko Server</strong> 4.2.2 (<em>or any newer daily version</em>). There are however some downsides: Overhauling the settings involved breaking the settings for all existing <code>3.x</code> installs. Additionally, support for Jellyfin 10.8 <em>and</em> TvDB IDs on entities has been removed, and episode numbers are now relative. The last change shouldn&rsquo;t affect anyone negatively unless you were using the hide episode feature <em>incorrectly</em> in Shoko Server.</p><p>Read on if you want to know more, or dive head-first into the release. üèä</p><h5 id=revamped-settings-ahead>Revamped Settings Ahead</h5><div class="alert alert-warning downloads-alert" role=alert><i class="downloads-alert-icon fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
Your plugin settings have been revamped and thus need reconfiguration.</div><p>In this update, we&rsquo;ve replaced many older settings with newer counterparts and added new settings for the newly added features. We&rsquo;ve rewritten the <em>Metadata Settings</em> section and the <em>Library Settings</em> section, removed the <em>Tag Settings</em> section, added new settings to the <em>User Settings</em> section, a new <em>Media Folder Settings</em>, <em>SignalR Connection</em> and <em>SignalR Settings</em> sections. Let&rsquo;s dive into the details of these changes.</p><p>The Metadata Settings section has been completely overhauled. We now have a new set of default settings with overrides per metadata item group. The Tag section has been removed, but the overhauled tag system internals now allow more granular control of tags, genres, content ratings, and production locations, all integrated into the metadata settings. The latter two were just recently added, while the former two were less configurable previously. Also, shout out to <strong>fearnlj01</strong> for their great contributions by implementing the new priority-based selectors you can find if you enable the override for a metadata item group. Without his help, we wouldn&rsquo;t have these new and fancy selectors that match what you see elsewhere in the Jellyfin Web UI. üôå</p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s look at the changes in the Library Settings section, as it has seen significant updates as well. The series/season merging option is gone ‚Äî replaced with a simple toggle to enable or disable Shoko Groups‚ÄØ‚Äî and along with it the TvDB/TMDB compatibility mode. Movie collections based on Shoko Groups are also gone, now replaced with the option to create collections for both movies and shows instead. Season ordering has been moved into this section, but the <em>Chronological Ordering</em> options are still considered <strong><em>experimental</em></strong> and should only be used if you&rsquo;re one of those people that can&rsquo;t live without a small abundance of potential catastrophe ahead, as it&rsquo;s still very much in the testing stages. In addition, we&rsquo;ve had a slew of new options added to this section since the last stable version.</p><p>Explore on your own or ask for help in our Discord while you wait for the new settings documentation to go live on <a href=https://docs.shokoanime.com/shokofin/configuration/ target=_blank rel=noopener>our site</a>. üìö</p><h5 id=enter-virtual-reali-_file-system_>Enter Virtual Reali‚Äì <em>File System</em></h5><p>Say hello to the new <strong>Virtual File System</strong> (<strong>VFS</strong>) üéâ, which is now enabled by default for all installs. It allows you to disregard the underlying disk file structure while automagically meeting Jellyfin&rsquo;s requirements for file organization. It also ensures that no unrecognized files appear in your library and allows us to fully leverage Jellyfin&rsquo;s native features better than we otherwise could without the feature. This enables us to effortlessly support trailers, special features, and theme videos for series, seasons <em>and</em> movies, merge partial episodes into a single entry, and offer better support for mixed type libraries¬π. All this is possible because we disregard the underlying disk file structure to create our own. Additionally, the VFS can be toggled on a per media library basis, giving you flexibility in how you manage your collections.</p><div class="alert alert-warning downloads-alert" role=alert><i class="downloads-alert-icon fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
With the VFS now being automatically enabled for all libraries, it is recommended to recreate any existing libraries that use Shokofin to speed up the transition to using the VFS. Otherwise Shokofin will start to migrate the existing libraries to the VFS on the next library scan or metadata refresh. For those who wish to not use the VFS, make sure to disable it in the plugin settings before the next scan or refresh event occurs to avoid any and/or destructive work being done.</div><p>You <em>can</em> achieve the same end results without the VFS layer if you build a custom renamer for Shoko Server to match the logic we have in our VFS layer for your physical library, but that requires having <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> of domain knowledge for how Jellyfin works, including some of its internal workings and all its expectations toward file system structures, how AniDB structures its anime on the site, how Shoko Server operates using both the plugin API and REST APIv3, and how Shokofin (this plugin) works internally and which settings you have configured the plugin to use. Instead of pushing all these requirements onto <em>you</em> as an end user or a Shoko Server plugin/renamer developer, we&rsquo;ve taken on the burden of managing the complexity in the plugin, allowing us to adapt the VFS layer according to the selected library type and selected plugin settings in Jellyfin, and metadata served from Shoko Server. üöÄ</p><p>While the approach taken to implement this feature is relatively new and might still fail in a few edge cases, it has been tested on <em>real libraries</em> for a while now and is now considered stable enough for daily use. If you do find any errors while using it, it is recommended to file an issue report either in our Discord server or on GitHub.</p><p>Because the VFS is automagically managed by the plugin, it should not be manually altered by the user. Any changes to the files managed by the plugin will be wiped on refresh. Changes in Shoko, such as adjustments to series movements or episode relocations, can trigger automatic updates in the VFS if the necessary SignalR events are enabled on the library. The exception to this are any subtitle files and any files within the extras folders that do not contain any Shoko IDs in their name, which can safely be added by the user and/or other plugins. We even support moving the subtitle files placed in the VFS besides a video file into the underlying &ldquo;real&rdquo; library so they will persist across library recreations! üíæ Though do note that the same cannot be said for any extras not managed by the plugin, as they&rsquo;re 100% out of our control because we cannot get a good anchor point to use in the underlying &ldquo;real&rdquo; library.</p><p>¬π <em>We support it in the plugin when using the VFS, but the support for mixed libraries in the core of Jellyfin is still flaky at best.</em></p><h5 id=seamless-fusion-of-episodes-and-seasons>Seamless Fusion of Episodes and Seasons</h5><p>We now calculate episode numbers relatively, which shouldn&rsquo;t affect most users under normal circumstances. However, if you&rsquo;re one of those people who hide episodes in Shoko for whatever reason, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to see a positive change in the episode numbering in Jellyfin as this feature hides any previously existing gaps. This update also paves the way for the newly implemented ‚Äî but still <strong><em>experimental</em></strong> ‚Äî season merging option, which allows us to blur the boundaries between AniDB entries by merging them into a single anime entry based on name matching and a configurable merge window ‚Äî <em>finally</em> fixing the split for those long standing same year entries for the same series, or more! Just do keep in mind that the implementation of this feature is still in the early stages and may need further tweaking, so for now, it‚Äôs reserved for <em>the daredevils who lust after new toys to play with</em> until we work out the kinks.</p><h5 id=collections-stirred-to-perfection>Collections Stirred to Perfection</h5><p>In order to create a seamless blend of different media types, we had to rethink and rework our collection support from the ground up. Imagine making a perfect smoothie ‚Äî you need the right mix of ingredients, and sometimes, you have to blend and adjust until everything fits just right. The last version was like forgetting to plug in the blender ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt actually hooked up properly!</p><p>We now have full plugin support for automagically creating collections for either your movies based on the Shoko Series or all movies <em>and</em> shows based on Shoko Groups. This can be used with the existing feature for using Shoko Groups to create show entities, in addition to supporting the sub-groups feature in Shoko Server, which allows you to nest multiple series into sub-groups. These groups and sub-groups will turn into nested collections in Jellyfin.</p><h5 id=real-time-sorcery-with-signalr>Real-Time Sorcery with SignalR</h5><p>SignalR is a library for ASP.NET developers that simplifies adding real-time web functionality to applications. Now, the SignalR stream from Shoko Server can be used as an optional feature in the plugin. It can auto-connect on startup and has customizable settings per media library and event group:</p><p><strong>File Events</strong> can be used alongside real-time monitoring on the media library or replace it. These events are triggered when a file already in the media library in Jellyfin, previously unrecognized (and thus not part of the library), becomes recognized (and thus should be made part of the library). This is something that real-time monitoring will not handle properly since there are no file events for when it happens.</p><p><strong>Refresh Events</strong> can be configured to react to specific metadata refresh events sent from Shoko. This ensures your metadata in Jellyfin is as up-to-date as possible with what is stored in Shoko Server, without needing to manually refresh the entities.</p><h5 id=enhanced-tags-ratings-and-locations>Enhanced Tags, Ratings, and Locations</h5><p>The internals for processing tags have been overhauled. We now use a tag hierarchy to filter tags locally instead of the filtering previously done on the Shoko Server side. This avoids magical numbers in code and gives us more control for searching for tags in the hierarchy. Custom tag support has been revamped to support a <em>fake</em> hierarchy using <code>/</code> (forward slash) as a separator between levels in the tag name. Top-level custom tags without &ldquo;child&rdquo; tags are added to the list if custom tags are enabled, while tags in the second level or below are treated as if they are part of the AniDB hierarchy. With this new system, we now leverage AniDB tags and custom tags from Shoko Server more effectively. Tags and genres on entities have been given better default settings, and we&rsquo;ve added more granular controls for overriding these defaults if needed. Feel free to tinker with the settings when you&rsquo;re bored. üòÑ</p><p>We&rsquo;ve also introduced content ratings and production locations, providing more native features supported by the plugin! Multiple sources for content ratings and production locations are already available in the settings, but support for TMDB content ratings and production locations will arrive at a later date, after Shoko Server adds support for it. We&rsquo;ve already added the settings to the UI to prepare your library for when it does. üöÄ</p><h6 id=content-ratings>Content Ratings</h6><p>Based on the tag hierarchy, we use the <code>/content indicators/*</code> and <code>/elements/*</code> tags to estimate the content rating for seasons and series based upon <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20210720014648/https://www.tvguidelines.org/resources/TheRatings.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener>this pdf available from the Web Archive</a>, since the web site in question has since removed it from their site.</p><p>The content ratings we support are:</p><ul><li><code>TV-G</code></li><li><code>TV-Y</code></li><li><code>TV-Y7</code> (Optionally with the <code>FV</code> indicator.)</li><li><code>TV-PG</code> (Optionally with <code>D</code>, <code>L</code>, <code>S</code>, and/or <code>V</code> indicators.)</li><li><code>TV-14</code> (Optionally with <code>D</code>, <code>L</code>, <code>S</code>, and/or <code>V</code> indicators.)</li><li><code>TV-MA</code> (Optionally with <code>L</code>, <code>S</code>, and/or <code>V</code> indicators.)</li><li><code>XXX</code> (Only for H content. üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è)</li></ul><p>We also support overriding the content ratings using custom tags, by creating and using a tag conforming to the following regular expression:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#e6db74>/^\/?target audience\/(?:tv[_\-]?)?(?:g|y|y7|pg|14|ma|xxx)(?:[_\-]?(fv|d|s|l|v){1,5})?$/i</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And here are some example custom tags that will override the content rating to <code>TV-PG</code> for any series if applied in Shoko:</p><ul><li><code>target audience/TV-PG</code> ‚Üí <code>TV-PG</code></li><li><code>Target Audience/TV-PG-DV</code> ‚Üí <code>TV-PG</code> + <code>D</code> & <code>V</code> indicators.</li><li><code>Target Audience/TV_PG_ld</code> ‚Üí <code>TV-PG</code> + <code>D</code> & <code>L</code> indicators.</li><li><code>/target audience/pgv</code> ‚Üí <code>TV-PG</code> + <code>V</code> indicator.</li><li><code>/TARGET AUDIENCE/TvPgSl</code> ‚Üí <code>TV-PG</code> + <code>L</code> & <code>S</code> indicators.</li></ul><h6 id=production-locations>Production Locations</h6><p>Production locations are added based on the <code>/origin/*</code> tags in the tag hierarchy. This is a straightforward 1:N mapping for relevant tags to production locations.</p><h6 id=series-type-overrides>Series Type Overrides</h6><p>We also added support for manually overriding the series type of a Shoko series using custom tags. This can be useful, for example, if you want to classify an AniDB movie series containing multiple movies as a <em>normal</em> show in Jellyfin. Use at your own discretion. üôÇ The tags are case-insensitive, and the trailing &rsquo;s&rsquo; and leading &lsquo;/&rsquo; are optional. Setting multiple tags won&rsquo;t break anything, as it will only use the type from the first assigned tag. To set an override, assign one of the following custom user tags:</p><ul><li><code>series type/tv</code> ‚Üí <code>TV</code></li><li><code>series type/tvspecial</code> ‚Üí <code>TVSpecial</code></li><li><code>series type/tvspecials</code> ‚Üí <code>TVSpecial</code></li><li><code>series type/tv special</code> ‚Üí <code>TVSpecial</code></li><li><code>series type/tv specials</code> ‚Üí <code>TVSpecial</code></li><li><code>series type/web</code> ‚Üí <code>Web</code></li><li><code>/series type/movie</code> ‚Üí <code>Movie</code></li><li><code>/series type/movies</code> ‚Üí <code>Movie</code></li><li><code>/series type/ova</code> ‚Üí <code>OVA</code></li><li><code>/series type/ovas</code> ‚Üí <code>OVA</code></li><li><code>/series type/other</code> ‚Üí <code>Other</code></li><li><code>/series type/others</code> ‚Üí <code>Other</code></li></ul><h5 id=additional-changes>Additional Changes</h5><p>Not everything made it into this blog post, so you can check out the <a href=https://github.com/ShokoAnime/Shokofin/releases/tag/v4.0.0 target=_blank rel=noopener>GitHub Release</a>, <a href=https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog/shokofin/ target=_blank rel=noopener>our changelog</a>, or the <a href=https://github.com/ShokoAnime/Shokofin/compare/3.0.1...4.0.0 target=_blank rel=noopener>full changelog on GitHub</a> if you crave more <em>minute details</em> on all the changes that went into this release. ü´£</p><h5 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s Next?</h5><p><strong>We&rsquo;re not done yet!</strong> There are still things to improve and new features to implement for the best possible experience. <del>Not to mention bugs to squash‚Ä¶ ü´†</del> The new docs are coming, with more Shokofin documentation along with it. <a href=https://www.themoviedb.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>TMDB</a> support is on the horizon in both Shoko Server and in the plugin ‚Äî which will help address the &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; images for movies within the same AniDB series entry, among other things in the plugin.
