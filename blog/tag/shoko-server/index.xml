Although it was explored, limitations related to WPF made this request near impossible and a huge time sink for the devs.
With the announcement of Shoko Desktop 2, its change from a C# program to a web application and the eventual decision to merge Shoko Desktop features into the Server Web UI.</description></item><item><title>Shoko Version 4.2.0 Released</title><link>https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-version-420-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 09:16:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-version-420-released/</guid><description>We are thrilled to announce the release of the latest version of Shoko!

Version 3.8 was our biggest release to date and was released a very long time after Version 3.7. We&amp;rsquo;ve decided that going forward we&amp;rsquo;re going to aim for releasing updates at least once a month to ease migration for current users and reduce the amount of testing needed beforehand. We&amp;rsquo;ve also made some changes to our versioning system which we&amp;rsquo;ve outlined below.</description></item><item><title>Shoko Version 3.8 Released</title><link>https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-version-3-8-released/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2017 21:18:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-version-3-8-released/</guid><description>After eight very long months, weâre pleased to announce that Shoko Version 3.8 is available for download!
While weâve added quite a few new features, fixed a lot of bugs and updated a lot of existing features and functionality, the main reason this release took longer than usual is due to the giant refactoring we did on the Shoko codebase.

After seven months of development, we&amp;rsquo;re close to releasing the next version of Shoko, Version 3.8! Looking back at our past releases, this upcoming version is by far the biggest release we&amp;rsquo;ve done so far. However with that being said, Version 3.8 is not really as feature packed as one might think based off the claim I just made, instead the majority of work has been to optimizing Server and Desktop code as these are essential to our overall goal of making Shoko Server cross-platform and the building of the new Shoko Desktop, currently codename ClientV2.</description></item><item><title>Shoko Version 3.7.0.4 Released</title><link>https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-version-3-7-0-4-released/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2017 03:45:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-version-3-7-0-4-released/</guid><description>Weâve released a maintenance update, version 3.7.0.4 for the following programs/plugins.

While originally scheduled for earlier this month, Shoko Version 3.7 is finally available for download!
Version 3.7 is a big milestone for us for a variety of reasons that all share the same goal, to make Shoko even better for both users and developers. Shoko is open-source for a reason, we want people to contribute, to implement new ideas, fix bugs or even optimize the code. We truly appreciate each and every person that has contributed to the project and want to make it even more easier to do so by addressing some of the issues that have been brought up.</description></item><item><title>JMM is Now Shoko!
