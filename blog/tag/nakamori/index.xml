This update is one of the most significant to date, as Nakamori has been entirely rewritten from the ground up to shift to Python 3 with Kodi 19.
However, due to the Kodi dev team&amp;rsquo;s decision, Nakamori is no longer backwards compatible with older versions of Kodi.</description></item><item><title>Version 3.6 Brings Speed and Streaming</title><link>https://shokoanime.com/blog/version-3-6-brings-speed-and-streaming/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2016 12:20:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shokoanime.com/blog/version-3-6-brings-speed-and-streaming/</guid><description>Hello Everyone,
After a very successful beta that helped in identifying previously unknown issues and extended internal testing, we&amp;rsquo;re pleased to announce that JMM Version 3.6.0.2 is available for download! Version 3.6 is by far the biggest update we&amp;rsquo;ve ever released containing over 40,000 lines of code added, changed and removed when compared to the previous version. While we generally try to limit the amount of new features added in the next version to reduce unforeseen issues, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to hold back completed features and decided to do the extra work that was required to release this update.</description></item><item><title>Version 3.6 Beta Released</title><link>https://shokoanime.com/blog/version-3-6-beta-released/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2016 07:39:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shokoanime.com/blog/version-3-6-beta-released/</guid><description>After completing our internal testing, we&amp;rsquo;re pleased to release a public beta for the upcoming version 3.6!
