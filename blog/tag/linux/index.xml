While we’ve added quite a few new features, fixed a lot of bugs and updated a lot of existing features and functionality, the main reason this release took longer than usual is due to the giant refactoring we did on the Shoko codebase. The great thing about this refactor is that everyone benefits from it.</description></item></channel></rss>
