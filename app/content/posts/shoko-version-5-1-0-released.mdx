Starting 2025 with a bang, we're happy to announce that Shoko Server 5.1.0 is now available! This releases focuses on
improving a lot of the underlying code, fixing bugs reported from verson 5.0.0 and working towards making sure ready
for some of the mroe bigger changes we have planned for 2025.

## TvDB Removed, TMDb Here We Come

In version 5.0.0, we introduced full support for TMDb while retaining some code and UI elements for TvDB. With this
latest release, we've officially removed all support for TheTVDB. This means that any data and images previously
downloaded from TvDB will be automatically removed from your database and deleted from your images folder. This
process is automatic and cannot be skipped.

We made the decision to remove TvDB support to prevent potential issues for our users and because there is no longer a
way to update data from TvDB.

## Utilities

With version 5.0.0, we completed the migration of all remaining utilities from Desktop to the Web UI. Now, we’re
focused on adding new utilities to make managing your collection even easier. For instance, one upcoming utility will
allow users to quickly view and correct TvDB links for individual series, making it simple to fix any mislinked episodes.

If you have ideas for new utilities, we’d love to hear from you on Discord!

## User Challenge - Add Some Themes!

Version 5.0.0 introduces support for custom themes in the Web UI, and we’re excited to see what our community can
create! We encourage you to design your own custom themes and share them with the community so others can enjoy and
use them too.

Check out our guide on [Creating a Web UI Theme](https://docs.shokoanime.com/shoko-server/webui-themes) on Shoko Docs
