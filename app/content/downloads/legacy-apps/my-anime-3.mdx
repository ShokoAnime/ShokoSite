My Anime 3 is our oldest media streaming plugin and the first to provide rich, detailed information for anime in media
streaming programs. Long before Shoko and even JMM, My Anime 3 allowed users to relax on their couch, load up Media
Portal, and watch their collection. Today, it continues to offer a seamless TV watching experience, now enhanced by
Shoko, which provides comprehensive management and detailed information for your anime collection.

**Due to time constraints and a shortage of developers using My Anime 3, weâ€™ve decided to put it into maintenance mode
and suspend active development. Any developers interested in continuing its development are welcome to contact us on
Discord.**
