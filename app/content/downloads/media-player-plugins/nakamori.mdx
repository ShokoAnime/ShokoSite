Nakamori combines Kodi's versatility with Shoko's power to bring your anime collection to life, pulling all necessary
information directly from Shoko, so you don't need to worry about folder or file names. It works on any device capable
of running Kodi, even giving that $20 Raspberry Pi a new purpose, though technical limitations might affect playback.
Nakamori is compatible with any supported Kodi skin, but highly customized or uncommon display options might cause
issues; for assistance, contact the skin developer or create an issue on the Nakamori GitHub repo. Just sit back, relax,
and enjoy your anime backlog.
