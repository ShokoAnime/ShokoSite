Plex, a leading user-generated streaming service, now supports Shoko, one of the best anime cataloging programs. Stream
your anime anywhere on any device, with Plex handling the streaming and Shoko Metadata providing detailed information.
Shoko Metadata pulls all info directly from Shoko, eliminating the need to manually correct mislinked series or movies
due to Plex's inadequate anime support. This saves you time and ensures your collection is accurately cataloged. Plex
Pass users benefit from built-in scrobbling, allowing watch state data to sync back to Shoko and upload to your
preferred community sites.

For information on the difference between Shoko Relay and Shoko Metadata,
check [Shoko Docs](https://docs.shokoanime.com/plex/installing-agents-scanners)
