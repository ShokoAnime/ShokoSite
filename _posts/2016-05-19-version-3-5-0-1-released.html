<p>UPDATE: If JMM Server will not start for you please re-download version 3.5.0.1. The initial upload was missing a .dll file that has since been added.
</p>

<p>After a very successful beta, JMM version 3.5.0.1 is available for download!
</p>

<p>Before I go into the details of what's new, we'd like to thank everyone that participated in the 3.5 beta. We received a lot of feedback that helped improve
   JMM with changes made and bugs discovered and fixed as a direct result. As a result we'll continue releasing beta builds for future versions so look forward
   to that.
</p>

<p>JMM version 3.5.0.1 is a major release with many additions, changes and bugs fixed. This post will highlight some of the bigger additions and changes in
   3.5.0.1, for a complete list check the
	<a href = "http://jmediamanager.org/changelog/">changelog</a>.
</p>

<h3>New Site Layout</h3>
<p>We've updated the site layout with a more modern and minimalist design that not only loads faster, it's more responsive. There are still some kinks here and
   there that we'll be ironing out in the next week or so. If you notice any issues, please report them on our Discord server.
</p>

<h3>Closing The Forums</h3>
<p>We've decided to close the forums, time constraints have caused them to become neglected and the popularity forums once had is slowly dwindling. We encourage
   everyone to come join us on Discord!
</p>

<h3>JMM Is Now Localized</h3>
<p>While initially introduced in an earlier version of JMM, JMM is now fully localized with support for the following languages.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>English</li>
	<li>English (UK)</li>
	<li>Dutch</li>
	<li>French</li>
	<li>German</li>
	<li>Italian</li>
	<li>Polish</li>
	<li>Russian</li>
	<li>Spanish</li>
</ul>

<p>With the exception of English and English (UK), the additional languages have been machine translated. This was done in order for us to include the
   additional languages without having to wait in proper translations from our community. However we would like to include more accurate translations in future
   versions of JMM and so have provided what we believe is the best method to allow our community to help provide better translations.
</p>

<h3>Metro View Comes To Series</h3>
<a href = "../../assets/images/blog/2016-05-19-version-3-5-0-1-released//JMM-Desktop-Collection-Simple-View.jpg"><img

		alt = "JMM Desktop - Collection Simple View"></a>

<p>You can now toggle the Metro View while viewing your series in the Collections tab!
</p>

<h3>JMM Desktop's Download Functions</h3>
<p>Users can one again browse and download from BakaBT and Animebytes thanks to a fix provided by Baine. As requested, Sukebei Nyaa has also been added to the
   list of available trackers and AnimeSuki was removed due to the site having removed all torrents years ago and no longer providing an index.
</p>

<h3>More Control With Plex and Kodi</h3>
<p>One issue that's been brought up before is the how long JMM Server takes to initialize your database if you have a big collection. Users can now
   enable/disable Plex and Kodi which should drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to initialize your database.
</p>

<h3>CrossRef Errors Fixed</h3>
<p>If you had manually linked files in a previous database and then switched databases or created a new one, your previously linked files would end up with an
   Anime ID of 0 and not link properly causing issues with JMM reporting missing files. Thanks to Baine this issue has been fixed and you should be able to
   properly re-link your files.
</p>

<h3>Plex Plugin Updated</h3>
<p>Version 3.5.0.1 introduces a lot of new Plex updates adding the ability to users to tie Plex users to JMM users, additional information displayed such as
   roles and genres and better thumbnail support.
</p>

<h3>Don't Forget About Nakamori</h3>
<p>Nakamori has gone through bit of a name change and dropped the plugin part from its name. A lot of work has been put into the latest version of Nakamori
   which has received multiple updates to enhance user experience and make it compatible with JMM 3.5.0.1. The official Nakamori website has also launched which
   you can checkout using the following link,<a href = "https://shokunin.monogatari.pl/nakamori/">https://shokunin.monogatari.pl/nakamori/</a>. In addition we
   will be transiting the support and install pages to the official ones on the Nakamori website.
</p>

<p>Again, these are just some of the additions and changes in 3.5.0.1, for a complete list check the
