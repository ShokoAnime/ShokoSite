<p>Shoko Version 3.9.1 is now available for download!
</p>

<p>We've made a few visual changes to the TvDB Linking system but beyond that, this is mostly a maintenance release addressing some issues that were discovered
	when attempting to update your AniDB MyList.
</p>

<p>For a complete list of changes, check out the <a href = "http://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog.html" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">Changelog</a>.
</p>

<p>Unless there are any major issues discovered after this release, this will be the last release in the 3.9.X series as we'll be working on some major changes
	going forward. The next major version, version 4.0.0 will see a lot of under-the-hood improvements that will benefit all users in the long-run. We'll be
	dropping nhibernate and replacing it with EF, dropping Nancy for ASP.NET and arguably the biggest change, moving to the newer .NET standard framework, which
	will allow better cross platform compatibility. These upcoming changes will require a lot of extensive testing so don't expect a stable release for a couple
	months. However if you'd like to help out with developing or testing, jump on Discord and contact a staff member.
