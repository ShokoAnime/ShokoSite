<p>Almost a month later and we're back with another update!
</p>

<p>Version 3.8 was our biggest release to date and was released a very long time after Version 3.7. We've decided that going forward we're going to aim for
	releasing updates at least once a month to ease migration for current users and reduce the amount of testing needed beforehand. We've also made some changes
	to our versioning system which we've outlined below.
</p>

<p>This release mainly focused on fixing issues caused by the previous release as well as adding better logging in both Server and Desktop. As always check the
	<a href = "http://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog.html" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">Changelog </a>for a complete list of changes made.
</p>

<h3>Shoko On Plex Updated</h3>
<p>We've updated Shoko on Plex making it compatible with the latest version of Shoko. This was a maintenance release so please report any issues you encounter
	on GitHub.
</p>

<h3>Changes to Versioning</h3>
<p>We've decided to change our versioning system a bit.
</p>

<p>Going forward we'll only be using a <strong>three-digit</strong> number for releases, the only time the <strong>fourth digit</strong> will be used is for
	dailies and beta release. This new versioning method will work better with our updated release schedule as we plan to only update the <strong>MINOR
		number</strong> when we've made a big changed or introduced a new feature.
</p>

<p>For those confused here's the breakdown.
</p>

<p><strong>Example: 3.8.1</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>MAJOR version number, only updated when significant changes are made.</li>
	<li>MINOR version number, updated when a significant feature is added.</li>
	<li>PATCH version number, when general changes are made.,</li>
</ul>
