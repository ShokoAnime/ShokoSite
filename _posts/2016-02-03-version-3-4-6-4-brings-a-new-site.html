<p>Hello Everyone,
</p>

<p>JMM has gone through a lot of changes over the past couple of months, both with JMM itself and as you might of noticed, the website as well. Before I go into
   detail about the new website and other changes lets talk about the new version of JMM!
</p>

<p>With each release, we'll cover a few of the new additions or changes but for a complete listing, check out the
	<a class = "blog-link" href = "https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">changelog</a>.
</p>


<h3>Nakamori, the JMM Plugin for Kodi</h3>
<p>The biggest change with Version 3.4.6.4 is the long awaited addition of Kodi support with the Nakamori Plugin! This was made possible by BigRetroMike, a
   member of our community who developed and maintains the Nakamori plugin. For installing instructions and general Nakamori usage check out the Nakamori
   documentation by clicking on Documentation in the above menu and selecting Nakamori. BigRetroMike is always looking for feedback on how to improve Nakamori
   so if you find anything wrong with it or would like to see a feature added, head over to the <a class = "blog-link"

			target = "_blank">Nakamori Github page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Hashing Speed Fix</h3>
<p>There's been a lot of discussion over the past couple of months over JMM's hashing speed, with Version 3.4.6.4 this discussion can be put to rest as hashing
   speeds have been improved.
</p>

<p>Here are some examples of the previous hashing speed.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hashed file in 7.1 seconds --- [DeadFish] Fairy Tail (2014) - 02 [720p][AAC] (247 MB)</li>
	<li>Hashed file in 46.3 seconds --- [Hatsuyuki]_Sword_Art_Online_-_Extra_Edition_[10bit][1280x720][73C2BC87] (1.53 GB)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples of the improved hashing speed
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hashed file in 1.3 seconds --- Haikyuu!! Second Season - 08 [02DD13E3].mkv (278 MB)</li>
	<li>Hashed file in 1.2 seconds --- [HorribleSubs] Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm - 04 [720p].mkv (325 MB)</li>
	<li>Hashed file in 6.1 seconds --- [xmbx] Gintama ː Yorinuki Gintama-san on Theater 2D - Shinsengumi Douran Hen [DVD 480P AAC] [7H302N1D] (798 MB)</li>
	<li>Hashed file in 10.4 seconds --- [NoobSubs] Sword of the Stranger (720p Blu-ray 8bit AAC).mp4 (1.53 GB)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are still experiencing problems, please open a issue on GitHub so we can help.
</p>

<h3>AniDB MyList Options Update</h3>
<p>Some new options were added to the Delete Action function under AniDB MyList Options. Double-check your settings as your selected option might have changed,
   additionally if you hover over the drop-down box the tooltip has been updated explaining what each option does.
</p>

<h3>New Website!</h3>
<p>Just by reading this you can see our new website for JMM. The biggest reason for moving away from GitHub Pages to a self-hosting solution is it allows us to
   have more control over the website and do what we want. WordPress (the CMS we're using) provides us with a lot more functionality then we had before and
   it's extremely easy to use, something that will be important for us going forward which we'll cover in a future blog post. The biggest loss however is the
   ability for anyone to submit a update to the website, while we're working on an alternative solution you can always contact
	<strong>ElementalCrisis</strong> on Discord if you'd like to help.
</p>

<p>The website is still being worked on and improved, if you noticed any problems or have suggestions then please send a message to
	<strong>ElementalCrisis</strong> on Discord. You can also expect a complete refresh to every page in the coming weeks, there's lot of information to update
   and new information to add.
</p>
